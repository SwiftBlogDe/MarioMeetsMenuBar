# [Mario meets OS X menu bar](https://github.com/SwiftBlogDe/MarioMeetsMenuBar) #

A little useless UI enhancement inspired by [bisqwit's E editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y71lli8MS8s) for OS X, created and maintained by [SwiftBlog.de](http://www.swift-blog.de) :rocket:.

A little Mario walking from left to right, all day long. The most useless UI addition for OS X you've ever seen, but well... it was fun to program and get the stuff working with best performance. 
* Highly optimized animation (:laughing:) - 0% CPU
* :zap: No additional power consumption
* Made without the need of :beer:
